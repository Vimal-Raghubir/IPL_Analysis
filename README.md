# IPL_Analysis
This repository stores the jupyter notebook used for my data science project where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on [IPL Cricket Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandkumarsahu09/ipl-player-stats-20162022).

The notebook can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vraghubir/ipl-batting-and-bowling-analysis-2016-2022). I also wrote articles explaining my analysis and the insights gained from this [here](https://vraghubir.medium.com/data-science-series-1-cricket-data-analysis-f0923f39462d).
